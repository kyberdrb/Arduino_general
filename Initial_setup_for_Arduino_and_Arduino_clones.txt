-Win+R and type  
  devmgmt.msc

For the sake of simplicity you can download and install 7-Zip:

  -Right click on Arduino device->Update driver software
  -Select "Browse my computer for driver software"
  -Click on "Browse" button and select folder, in which you extracted arduino robojax driver.
  -Click on "Next"
  -Wait until the installation finishes
  -After that, close Device Manager
  
-Run Arduino IDE
-Connect Arduino to the computer
-Select the COM port with Arduino:
  -Go to Tools->Port
