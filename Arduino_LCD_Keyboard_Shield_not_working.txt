If a brand new Arduino LCD Keyboard Shield is not working (not displaying
anything on the display) it is very likely, that is not broken - it just
needs a little adjustment.

The solution lies in adjusting the contrast of the LCD display via the
potentiometer on the shield.

If you have potentiometer model "3362"
    turn it slowly to the left, until you see the text.
    
If you have potentiometer model "3296"
    you have to make several tens of turns to the right, until you see the text.
